Various bugs that have been found while using the app.

# COMPLETED (2026-02-27)

    - [x] The recipe for batches that are macerated needs to be shown for a maceration card the same as it is for the mash card
    - [x] The pagnation of all the tables isn't working. The initial number is shown but you are unable to page through to later things.
    - [x] On the barrel page, I would like clicking on the barrel to lead to the batch page for that barrel
    - [x] Due to the number of batches that will be in a barrel at any given time, I would like to remove it from the batches page
    - [x] The Customer newsletter sign up doesn't add to our customer list on our admin page. Instead it shows up in the contacts witha newsletter chip. I'd like that to show up in customers
    - [x] I do not see where the "Send us a message" on our contact page sends the info. This should show up on as a message. We might need an inbox for these to land for them to be seen.
    - [x] The items page need filtering options to filter by the category of the items.
