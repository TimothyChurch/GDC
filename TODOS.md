# Items to work on

- Need to be able to edit barrel entry date and proof.
- Spirit runs need section for inputting the heads, late head, hearts, & tails with volume, abv, and vessel
- Barrels need to be able to set individual age goals with the default based on barrel size. 12 months for 5 gal, 15 months for 10 gal, 18 months for 15 gal, & 24 months for 30 gal. These defaults should have a location to adjust them either in the barrel page via a button or in the admin settings page.
- When selecting barrel for batch transfer, only empty barrels should show in drop down.
- Batch page should have a space for notes with date input, sample abv, and tasting notes
- Once a barrel is dumped it should have a tag added showing it is a used barrel. This should be available for edit as well for adding newly purchased used barrels
- When barreled, the cost of the barrel should be added to the overall batch cost. It should be visable on the batch page next to the recipe cost.
- When moving batch to production it should go to creating a new production record
- There should be the ability to input or adjust the production date on the product portion of the wizard
- The costs on the production should be broken out: Batch, Barrel, Bottling, Taxes, etc.
- Bottles page doesn't need the list of inventory records, only the graph
- Production records of the bottle should be included on the bottle page and the most recent should be used to get the cost/bottle
- On the recipe page, it would be nice to be able to edit ingredient in line vs having to delete them and add them back to adjust amounts
- Each item should have a notes section for any needed misc details just as avg weight per unit
- There should be an admin settings page. It will include things like editing/adding item categories, adjust theme colors, editing/adding processing stages, and future admin settings. Use best judgement as to other adjustments that could go there.
- The pagenation of the tables throughout the app is not functioning. All items are shown even though the result per page and number of pages are set. This will need to be fixed
- For items, there should be the ability to opt out and not track inventory as needed.
- Items that are marked out of stock should not be on inventory sheets
- When a PO or Production is completed, the amount should be added to the current inventory for the item and in stock adjusted
- Once an item has an inventory history & a use/month, there should be a generated shopping list that shows all low and out of stock items that need to be purchase. Items without inventory history should be excluded.
