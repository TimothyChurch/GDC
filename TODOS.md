# Individual Batch Page

- Each stage of the pipeline excluding upcoming needs to create a new card on the batch page. Each of these card will have different details that can be inputted, editted, or deleted.

    - These reading will show in a list showing the date, gravity reading, current abv, and percentage done vs the initial potential

## Distilling Phase

    - This card will have the ability to input cuts as we currently do in the transfer stage.
    - There will be an add cut button that opens a line to input the data for multiple cuts
    - Each of these input lines will contain volume, volume unit selector, abv, receiving vessel selector, and an option to check that it was deposed of for records.
